<p>In this blog post, we introduce and discuss <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17003">“Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D”</a> <d-cite key="hoogeboom2022equivariant"></d-cite>, 
which first introduced 3D molecule generation using diffusion models. Their Equivariant Diffusion Model (EDM) also
incorporating an Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN) architecture, effectively grounding the model with inductive
priors about the symmetries in 3D space. EDM demonstrated strong improvement over other (non-diffusion) generative 
methods for molecules at the time, and inspired many subsequent works <d-cite key="anstine2023generative"></d-cite><d-cite key="corso2023diffdock"></d-cite><d-cite key="igashov2024equivariant"></d-cite><d-cite key="xu2023geometric"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>Traditional diffusion is unfortunately bottle-necked by the sequential denoising process, which can be slow and 
computationally expensive <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>. Hence, we also introduce <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469">“Consistency Models”</a> <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>
and aim to demonstrate that an EDM can be trained significantly faster in this framework, enabling it to generate 
samples with as little as a single step.</p>

<p>Using Consistency Models can be a step towards enabling much larger GNN backbones, eventually observing 
similar scaling effects as other domains including language <d-cite key="brown2020language"></d-cite><d-cite key="kaplan2020scaling"></d-cite><d-cite key="touvron2023llama"></d-cite>

Such improvement has been demonstrated in training Graph Neural Networks (GNN) <d-cite key="sriram2022towards"></d-cite>,
and scaling model parameters to take advantage of increasingly larger compute availability, is generally known to improve 
model performance <d-cite key="dosovitskiy2020image"></d-cite><d-cite key="kaplan2020scaling"></d-cite><d-cite key="krizhevsky2012imagenet"></d-cite>.</p>

<h4 id="briefly-on-equivariance-for-molecules">Briefly on Equivariance for molecules</h4>

<p>Equivariance is a property of certain functions, which ensures that their output transforms in a predictable manner under 
collections of transformations. This property is valuable in molecular modeling, where it can be used to ensure that the 
properties of molecular structures are consistent with their symmetries in the real world. Specifically, we are interested 
in ensuring that structure is preserved in the representation of a molecule under three types of transformations: 
<em>translation, rotation, and reflection</em>.</p>

<p>Formally, we say that a function $f$ is equivariant to the action of a group $G$ if:</p>

\[T_g(f(x)) = f(S_g(x)) \qquad \text{(1)}\]

<p>for all $g \in G$, where $S_g,T_g$ are linear representations related to the group element $g$ <d-cite key="serre1977linear"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>The three transformations: <em>translation, rotation, and reflection</em>, form the Euclidean group $E(3)$, which is the group of all aforementioned isometries in three-dimensional space, for which $S_g$ and 
$T_g$ can be represented by a translation $t$ and an orthogonal matrix $R$ that rotates or reflects coordinates.</p>

<p>A function $f$ is then equivariant to a rotation or reflection $R$ if:</p>

\[Rf(x) = f(Rx) \qquad \text{(2)}\]

<p>meaning transforming its input results in an equivalent transformation of its output. <d-cite key="hoogeboom2022equivariant"></d-cite></p>

<h4 id="introducing-equivariant-graph-neural-networks-egnns">Introducing Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs)</h4>
<p>Molecules can very naturally be represented with graph structures, where the nodes are the atoms and edges their bonds. 
The features of each atom, such as its element type or charge can be encoded into an embedding $\mathbf{h}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ 
alongside with its 3D position $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$.</p>

<p>To learn and operate on such structured inputs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (TBA - citation) have been developed, 
operating with the message passing paradigm (TBA - citation). This architecture consists of several layers, 
each of which updates the representation of each node, using the information in nearby nodes.</p>

<p>The previously mentioned E(3) equivariance property of molecules can be injected as an inductive prior into to the model 
architecture of a message passing graph neural network, resulting in an E(3) EGNN. This property improves generalisation <d-cite key="hoogeboom2022equivariant"></d-cite> and also beats similar non-equivariant Graph Convolution Networks on 
the molecular generation task <d-cite key="verma2022modular"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>The EGNN is built with <em>equivariant</em> graph convolution layers (EGCLs):</p>

\[\mathbf{x}^{l+1},\mathbf{h}^{l+1}=EGCL[ \mathbf{x}^l, \mathbf{h}^l ] \qquad \text{(3)}\]

<p>An EGCL layer can be formally defined by:</p>

<div align="center">

$$
\mathbf{m}_{ij} = \phi_e(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \mathbf{h}_j^l, d^2_{ij}) \qquad \text{(4)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{h}_i^{l+1} = \phi_h\left(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \sum_{j \neq i} \tilde{e}_{ij} \mathbf{m}_{ij}\right) \qquad \text{(5)}
$$

$$
\mathbf{x}_i^{l+1} = \mathbf{x}_i^l + \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\mathbf{x}_i^l \mathbf{x}_j^l}{d_{ij} + 1} \phi_x(\mathbf{h}_i^l, \mathbf{h}_j^l, d^2_{ij}) \qquad \text{(6)}
$$

</div>

<p>where $h_l$ represents the feature $h$ at layer $l$, $x_l$ represents the coordinate at layer $l$ and 
\(d_{ij}= ||x_i^l-x^l_j||_2\) is the Euclidean distance between nodes \(v_i\) and \(v_j\).</p>

<p>A fully connected neural network is used to learn the functions \(\phi_e\), \(\phi_x\), and \(\phi_h\). 
At each layer, a message \(m_{ij}\) is computed from the previous layer’s feature representation. 
Using the previous feature and the sum of these messages, the model computes the next layer’s feature representation.</p>

<p>This architecture then satisfies translation and rotation equivariance. Notably, the messages depend on the distance 
between the nodes and these distances are not changed by isometric transformations.</p>

<p>This section introduces diffusion models and describes how their predictions can be made E(3) equivariant. 
The categorical properties of atoms are already invariant to E(3) transformations, hence, we are only

<p>Diffusion models <d-cite key="sohl2015deep"></d-cite><d-cite key="ho2020denoising"></d-cite> are inspired by the principles 
of diffusion in physics, and model the flow of a data distribution to pure noise over time. A neural network is then 
trained to learn a reverse process that reconstructs samples on the data distribution from pure noise samples.</p>

        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The “forward” noising process can be parameterized by a Markov process <d-cite key="ho2020denoising"></d-cite>, 
where transition at each time step $t$ adds Gaussian noise with a variance of $\beta_t \in (0,1)$:</p>

\[\begin{align}
q\left( x_t \mid x_{t-1} \right) := \mathcal{N}\left( x_t ; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I} \right) &amp; \qquad \text{(7)}
\end{align}\]

<p>The whole Markov process leading to time step $T$ is given as a chain of these transitions:</p>

\[\begin{align}
q\left( x_1, \ldots, x_T \mid x_0 \right) := \prod_{t=1}^T q \left( x_t \mid x_{t-1} \right) &amp; \qquad \text{(8)}
\end{align}\]

<p>The “reverse” process transitions are unknown and need to be approximated using a neural network parametrized by $\theta$:</p>

\[p_\theta \left( x_{t-1} \mid x_t \right) := \mathcal{N} \left( x_{t-1} ; \mu_\theta \left( x_t, t \right), \Sigma_\theta \left( x_t, t \right) \right) \qquad \text{((9))}\]

<p>Because we know the dynamics of the forward process, the variance $\Sigma_\theta \left( x_t, t \right)$ at time $t$ is 
known and can be fixed to $\beta_t \mathbf{I}$.</p>

<p>The predictions then only need to obtain the mean $\mu_\theta \left( x_t, t \right)$, given by:</p>

\[\mu_\theta \left( x_t, t \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{\beta\_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}\_t}} \epsilon\_\theta \left( x_t, t \right) \right) \qquad \text{(10)}\]

<p>where $\alpha_t = \Pi_{s=1}^t \left( 1 - \beta_s \right)$.</p>

<p>Hence, we can directly predict $x_{t-1}$ from $x_{t}$ using the network $\theta$:</p>

\[\begin{align}
x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_t}} \left( x_t - \frac{\beta_t}{\sqrt{1 - \alpha_t}} \epsilon_\theta \left( x_t, t \right) \right) + \sqrt{\beta_t} v_t &amp; \qquad \text{(11)}
\end{align}\]

<p>where $v_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$ is a sample from the pure Gaussian noise.</p>

<!--- check rotations and reflections or jsut rotations? --->
<p>Equivariance to rotations and reflections effectively means that if any orthogonal rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ is 
applied to a sample \(\mathbf{x}_t\) at any given time step $t$, we should still generate a correspondingly rotated 
“next best sample” $\mathbf{R}\mathbf{x}_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$.</p>

<p>In other words, the likelihood of this next best sample does not depend on the molecules rotation and the probability 
distribution for each transition in the Markov Chain is roto-invariant:</p>

\[p(y|x) = p(\mathbf{R}y|\mathbf{R}x) \qquad \text{(21)}\]

<p>An invariant distribution composed with an equivariant invertible function results in an invariant distribution <d-cite key="kohler2020equivariant"></d-cite>. 
Furthermore, if $x \sim p(x)$ is invariant to a group, and the transition probabilities of a Markov chain $y \sim p(y|x)$ 
are equivariant, then the marginal distribution of $y$ at any time step $t$ is also invariant to that group <d-cite key="xu2022geodiff"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>Since the underlying EGNN already ensures equivariance, the initial sampling distribution can easily be constrained 
to something roto-invariant, such as a simple mean zero Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix, as seen in Figure 5 (left).</p>

<p>Translations require a few more tricks. It has been shown, that it is impossible to have non-zero distributions 
invariant to translations <d-cite key="satorras2021en"></d-cite>. Intuitively, the translation invariance property 
means that any point $\mathbf{x}$ results in the same assigned $p(\mathbf{x})$, leading to a uniform distribution, 
which, if stretched over an unbounded space, would be approaching zero-valued probabilities thus not integrating 
to one.</p>

<p>The EDM authors bypass this with a clever trick of always re-centering the generated samples to have center of gravity at
$\mathbf{0}$ and further show that these $\mathbf{0}$-centered distributions lie on a linear subspace that can reliably be used 
for equivariant diffusion <d-cite key="hoogeboom2022equivariant"></d-cite><d-cite key="xu2022geodiff"></d-cite>.</p>

<!---
We hypothesize that, intuitively, moving a coordinate from e.g. 5 to 6 on any given axis is the same as moving from 
8 to 9. But EDM predicts the actual atom positions, not a relative change, hence the objective needs to adjusted. 
By constraining the model to this "subspace" of options where the center of the molecule is always at $\mathbf{0}$, 
the absolute positions are effectively turned into relative ones w.r.t. to the center of the molecule, hence the model 
can now learn relationships that do not depend on the absolute position of the whole molecule in 3D space.

<h3 id="how-to-train-the-edm">How to train the EDM?</h3>

<p>The training objective of diffusion-based generative models amounts to <strong>“maximizing the log-likelihood of the 
sample on the original data distribution.”</strong></p>

<p>During training, our model learns to approximate the parameters of a posterior distributions at the next time
step by minimizing the KL divergence between this estimate and the ground truth, which is equivalent
to minimizing the negative log likelihood (TBA - reference).</p>

\[L_{vlb} := L_{t-1} := D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_{t}, x_{0}) \parallel p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t})) \qquad \text{(20)}\]

<p>The EDM adds a caveat that the predicted distributions must be calibrated to have center of gravity at $\mathbf{0}$, 
in order to ensure equivariance.</p>

<p>Using the KL divergence loss term with the EDM model parametrization simplifies the loss function to:</p>

\[\mathcal{L}_t = \mathbb{E}_{\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}_{x_h}(0, \mathbf{I})} \left[ \frac{1}{2} w(t) \| \epsilon_t - \hat{\epsilon}_t \|^2 \right] \qquad \text{(22)}\]

<p>where 
$ w(t) = \left(1 - \frac{\text{SNR}(t-1)}{\text{SNR}(t)}\right)$ and $ \hat{\epsilon}_t = \phi(z_t, t)$.</p>

<p>The EDM authors found that the model performs best with a constant $w(t) = 1$, thus effectively simplifying 
the loss function to an MSE. Since coordinates and categorical features are on different scales, it was also 
found that scaling the inputs before inference and then rescaling them back also improves performance.</p>

<h2 id="consistency-models">Consistency Models</h2>

<p>As previously mentioned, diffusion models are bottlenecked by the sequential denoising process <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>.
Consistency Models reduce the number of steps during de-noising up to just a single step, significantly speeding up 
this costly process, while allowing for a controlled trade-off between speed and sample quality.</p>

<h3 id="modelling-the-noising-process-as-an-sde">Modelling the noising process as an SDE</h3>

<p>Song et al. <d-cite key="song2021score"></d-cite> have shown that the noising process in diffusion can be described with a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)
transforming the data distribution $p_{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x})$ in time:</p>

\[d\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{\mu}(\mathbf{x}_t, t) dt + \sigma(t) d\mathbf{w}_t \qquad \text{(23)}\]

<p>Where $t$ is the time-step, $\mathbf{\mu}$ is the drift coefficient, $\sigma$ is the diffusion coefficient,
and $\mathbf{w}_t$ is the stochastic component denoting standard Brownian motion. This stochastic component effectively
represents the iterative adding of noise to the data in the forward diffusion process and dictates the shape of the final
distribution at time $T$.</p>

<p>Typically, this SDE is designed such that $p_T(\mathbf{x})$ at the final time-step $T$ is close to a tractable Gaussian.</p>

<h3 id="existence-of-the-pf-ode">Existence of the PF ODE</h3>

<p>This SDE has a remarkable property, that a special ODE exists, whose trajectories sampled at $t$ are distributed
according to $p_t(\mathbf{x})$ <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>:</p>

\[d\mathbf{x}_t = \left[ \mathbf{\mu}(\mathbf{x}_t, t) - \frac{1}{2} \sigma(t)^2 \nabla \log p_t(\mathbf{x}_t) \right] dt \qquad \text{(24)}\]

<p>This ODE is dubbed the Probability Flow (PF) ODE by Song et al. <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite> and corresponds to the different view of diffusion
manipulating probability mass over time we hinted at in the beginning of the section.</p>

<p>A score model $s_\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$ can be trained to approximate $\nabla log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ via score matching <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>.
Since we know the parametrization of the final distribution $p_T(\mathbf{x})$ to be a standard Gaussian parametrized 
with $\mathbf{\mu}=0$ and $\sigma(t) = \sqrt{2t}$, this score model can be plugged into the equation (24) and the 
expression reduces itself to an empirical estimate of the PF ODE:</p>

<p>Given any of-the-shelf ODE solver (e.g. Euler) and a trained score model $s_\phi(\mathbf{x}, t)$, we can solve this PF ODE.
The time horizon $[\epsilon, T]$ with $\epsilon$ very close to zero is discretized into sub-intervals for improved performance <d-cite key="karras2022elucidating"></d-cite>. A solution trajectory, denoted $\{\mathbf{x}_t\}$, 
is then given as a finite set of samples $\mathbf{x}_t$ for every discretized time-step $t$ between $\epsilon$ and $T$.</p>

<h3 id="consistency-function">Consistency Function</h3>

<p>Given a solution trajectory \({\mathbf{x}_t}\), we define the <em>consistency function</em> as:</p>

<p align="center">
$f:$ $(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$ $\to$ $\mathbf{x}_{\epsilon}$ 
</p>

<p>In other words, a consistency function always outputs a corresponding datapoint at time $\epsilon$, i.e. very close to
the original data distribution for every pair ($\mathbf{x}_t$, t).</p>

<p>Importantly, this function has the property of <em>self-consistency</em>: i.e. its outputs are consistent for arbitrary pairs of
$(x_t, t)$ that lie on the same PF ODE trajectory. Hence, we have $f(x_t, t) = f(x_{t’}, t’)$ for all $t, t’ \in [\epsilon, T]$.</p>

<p>The goal of a <em>consistency model</em>, denoted by $f_\theta$, is to estimate this consistency function $f$ from data by
being enforced with this self-consistency property during training.</p>

### Boundary Condition & Function Parametrization

For any consistency function $f(\cdot, \cdot)$, we must have $f(x_\epsilon, \epsilon) = x_\epsilon$, i.e., $f(\cdot, 
\epsilon)$ being an identity function. This constraint is called the _boundary condition_ <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>.

The boundary condition has to be met by all consistency models, as we have hinted before that much of the training relies
on the assumption that $p_\epsilon$ is borderline identical to $p_0$. However, it is also a big architectural
constraint on consistency models.

For consistency models based on deep neural networks, there are two ways to implement this boundary condition almost
for free <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>. Suppose we have a free-form deep neural network $F_\theta (x, t)$ whose output has the same dimensionality
as $x$.

1.) One way is to simply parameterize the consistency model as:

$$
f_\theta (x, t) =
\begin{cases}
x & t = \epsilon \\
F_\theta (x, t) & t \in (\epsilon, T]
\end{cases} \\
\qquad \text{(27)}
$$

2.) Another method is to parameterize the consistency model using skip connections, that is:

$$
f_\theta (x, t) = c_{\text{skip}} (t) x + c_{\text{out}} (t) F_\theta (x, t) \qquad \text{(28)}
$$

where $c_{\text{skip}} (t)$ and $c_{\text{out}} (t)$ are differentiable functions such that $c_{\text{skip}} (\epsilon) = 1$,
and $c_{\text{out}} (\epsilon) = 0$.

This way, the consistency model is differentiable at $t = \epsilon$ if $F_\theta (x, t)$, $c_{\text{skip}} (t)$, $c_{\text{out}} (t)$
are all differentiable, which is critical for training continuous-time consistency models.

In our work, we utilize the latter methodology in order to satisfy the boundary condition.
--->

<h3 id="sampling">Sampling</h3>

<p>With a fully trained consistency model $f_\theta(\cdot, \cdot)$, we can generate new samples by simply sampling from the initial
Gaussian $\hat{x_T}$ $\sim \mathcal{N}(0, T^2I)$ and propagating this through the consistency model to obtain
samples on the data distribution $\hat{x_{\epsilon}}$ $= f_\theta(\hat{x_T}, T)$ with as little as one diffusion step.</p>

<h3 id="training-consistency-models">Training Consistency Models</h3>

<p>Consistency models can either be trained by “distillation” from a pre-trained diffusion model, or in “isolation” as a standalone generative model from scratch. In the context of our work, we focused only on the latter because the distillation approach has a hard requirement of using a pretrained score based diffusion. 
In order to train in isolation we ned to leverage the following unbiased estimator:</p>

\[\nabla \log p_t(x_t) = - \mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{x_t - x}{t^2} \middle| x_t \right] \qquad \text{(29)}\]

<p>where $x \sim p_\text{data}$ and $x_t \sim \mathcal{N}(x; t^2 I)$.</p>

<p>That is, given $x$ and $x_t$, we can estimate $\nabla \log p_t(x_t)$ with $-(x_t - x) / t^2$.
This unbiased estimate suffices to replace the pre-trained diffusion model in consistency distillation
when using the Euler ODE solver in the limit of $N \to \infty$ <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>Song et al. <d-cite key="song2023consistency"></d-cite> justify this with a further theorem in their paper and show that the consistency training objective (CT loss)
can then be defined as:</p>

<p align="center">
$\mathcal{L}_{CT}^N (\theta, \theta^-)$ = $\mathbb{E}[\lambda(t_n)d(f_\theta(x + t_{n+1} \mathbf{z}, t_{n+1}), f_{\theta^-}(x + t_n \mathbf{z}, t_n))]$ $\qquad \text{(30)}$
</p>

<p>where $\mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.</p>

<p>Crucially, $\mathcal{L}(\theta, \theta^-)$ only depends on the online network $f_\theta$, and the target network
$f_{\theta^-}$, while being completely agnostic to diffusion model parameters $\phi$.</p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>TBA</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Consistency models are able to reduce the number of steps during de-noising up to just a single step, significantly 
speeding up the sampling process, while allowing for a controlled trade-off between speed and sample quality.
We were able to successfully demonstrate this and train an EDM as a consistency model in isolation, achieving nearly 
identical training and validation losses as the original implementation. However, using the single-step 
only reliably achieves around 15% atom stability in the best case scenario, compared with over 90% for the default EDM.
Using multi-step sampling should in theory yield competitive results, but we observed no such improvement.</p>

<p>Since it cannot be ruled out that this was caused by a bug in our multi-step sampling code, we hope to continue 
investigating if the consistency model paradigm can reliably be used for molecule generation in the future
and show more competitive results as previous works suggest <d-cite key="fan2023ecconf"></d-cite>.</p>

<p>This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax 3</a> engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p>

<p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:</p>

\[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\]

<p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p>

<h2 id="citations">Citations</h2>

<p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.</p>

<p>The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p>

<p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p>

<h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2>

<p>The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d-article</code> element.</p>

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>

<p>For images you want to display a little larger, try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-page</code>:</p>

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

<p>All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:</p>

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

<p>Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-screen</code>.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.</p>

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>

<p>The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.l-body</code> sized text except on mobile screen sizes.</p>

<p>Emphasis, aka italics, with <em>asterisks</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*asterisks*</code>) or <em>underscores</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_underscores_</code>).</p>

<p>Strong emphasis, aka bold, with <strong>asterisks</strong> or <strong>underscores</strong>.</p>

<p>Combined emphasis with <strong>asterisks and <em>underscores</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Strikethrough uses two tildes. <del>Scratch this.</del></p>

⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.</li>
  <li>Actual numbers don’t matter, just that it’s a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list</li>
  <li>And another item.</li>
</ol>

<p>⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we’ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).</p>

<p>⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unordered list can use asterisks</p>

<p>Colons can be used to align columns.</p>

<p>There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don’t need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.</p>

    <tr>
      <th>Markdown</th>
      <th>Less</th>
      <th>Pretty</th>

  <p>This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let’s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can <em>put</em> <strong>Markdown</strong> into a blockquote.</p>

<p>Here’s a line for us to start with.</p>

<p>This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a <em>separate paragraph</em>.</p>

<p>This line is also a separate paragraph, but…
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it’s a separate line in the <em>same paragraph</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Albert Einstein</name></author><category term="distill" /><category term="formatting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an example of a distill-style blog post and main elements]]></summary></entry></feed>
